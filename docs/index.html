            <h2>Welcome to the World of Musicals!</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I’m Grace, and my love for musicals has been a journey filled with unforgettable moments. My first encounter with musicals was in third grade, when my mom enrolled me in a musical camp. There, a professional musical actress taught us songs, dances, and acting. We performed numbers from <em>FAME</em>, which became my first hands-on experience with the magical world of musicals. Around the same time, I had another eye-opening experience during a family trip to New York. I had the chance to watch <em>The Lion King</em> on Broadway, and I was completely mesmerized by the stunning visuals, elaborate costumes, and beautiful music. Even as a child, I felt the magic and grandeur of live theater.

                A few years later, in seventh grade, I was given a school assignment to explore arts and culture. For this, I watched <em>Napoleon</em>, a lesser-known musical that left a modest impression on me. At the time, I thought my connection to musicals ended there.

                Years later, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I stumbled upon a YouTube video of someone creatively covering <em>Chicago</em>'s "Cell Block Tango." The performer added her own flair, emphasizing the individual stories of the murderesses, which reignited my curiosity. This led me to rediscover <em>Chicago</em>, which became the first musical I truly wanted to watch.

                In high school, I began learning about classics like <em>Rent</em> and <em>Les Misérables</em>. However, my passion truly blossomed after my high school graduation, when I traveled to Korea and saw the <em>Death Note</em> musical. That experience turned me into a dedicated musical fan, especially after discovering actor Kim Sung Cheol. I soon started attending various performances, including <em>Harlan County</em> and the Broadway tour of <em>Chicago</em>. I even invested in opera glasses and binoculars to enhance my experience.

                On a return trip to Korea during the winter, I watched <em>Monte Cristo</em>, <em>Il Tenore</em>, <em>Rebecca</em>, and more. Back in the U.S., my passion persisted as I saw <em>Six</em> and <em>Wicked</em>. Now, I’m eagerly looking forward to <em>Kinky Boots</em>, <em>Jekyll and Hyde</em>, <em>Frankenstein</em>, and <em>Hadestown</em>. Musicals have shaped my creativity and perspective, and I can’t wait to see where this passion takes me next.
