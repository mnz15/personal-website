            <h2>My Journey Through Musicals</h2>
            <p>
                Musicals hold a special place in my heart as the perfect blend of storytelling, music, and performance. They bring characters and emotions to life in a way no other art form can. I was first captivated by the grandeur of <em>Les Misérables</em>, where every note and lyric seemed to carry the weight of human struggle and hope. From there, my passion grew as I explored <em>Phantom of the Opera</em>, <em>Hamilton</em>, and more, realizing that each musical offers its own unique message and aesthetic.

                What I love most about musicals is their ability to immerse the audience. The orchestrated music heightens emotions, the choreographed dance adds visual storytelling, and the set designs transform simple stages into entire worlds. Watching a production feels like stepping into a dream where art and reality coexist seamlessly.

                I’m particularly inspired by Korean adaptations of classic musicals. They reimagine familiar productions with fresh energy, adding cultural nuances that resonate deeply. Beyond just watching, I enjoy analyzing the lyrics, costume choices, and symbolism that make musicals unforgettable.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, I aspire to contribute to this art form—whether through production, creative design, or storytelling—to create experiences that connect people emotionally, just as musicals have connected me.
